## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- I used SCSS

### What I learned

I learned how to create a dynamic website using only JavaScript, without relying on any libraries. I used SCSS to improve the styling of each element, and I also learned how to organize files using the module. My problem-solving skills have improved as a result of this challenge.
